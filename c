[32m++<<<<<<< HEAD[m
[32m +This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).[m
[32m +[m
[32m +## Available Scripts[m
[32m +[m
[32m +In the project directory, you can run:[m
[32m +[m
[32m +### `npm start`[m
[32m +[m
[32m +Runs the app in the development mode.<br>[m
[32m +Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.[m
[32m +[m
[32m +The page will reload if you make edits.<br>[m
[32m +You will also see any lint errors in the console.[m
[32m +[m
[32m +### `npm test`[m
[32m +[m
[32m +Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>[m
[32m +See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.[m
[32m +[m
[32m +### `npm run build`[m
[32m +[m
[32m +Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>[m
[32m +It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.[m
[32m +[m
[32m +The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>[m
[32m +Your app is ready to be deployed![m
[32m +[m
[32m +See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.[m
[32m +[m
[32m +### `npm run eject`[m
[32m +[m
[32m +**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**[m
[32m +[m
[32m +If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.[m
[32m +[m
[32m +Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.[m
[32m +[m
[32m +You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.[m
